# Breadth-First Search
Let's say we wanted to find out the minimum number of steps the knight could take to get to the pawn. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8bBKZAz.png" width="300">

We could probably determine the answer to this problem fairly quickly in our head. But how would we use a computer to solve this problem efficiently?

Breadth-first search, or simply BFS, is a search algorithm which can be used to find the minimum number of steps to get from one place to another. BFS uses a data type called a "queue", which follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method. This means that the first object added into a queue will always be the first to be removed. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5qZgk74.png" height="250">
